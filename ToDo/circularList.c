// Write a program that creates a circular linked list and then prints only those nodes which happen to be in the range 120 to 255.
//program of a circular linked list that does not allow the first node to contain a value 0. If the first node has 0, remove it from the list and make the second node, the first node.
//Write a program that counts the total number of nodes in a doubly-linked list. Counting should begin from the last node only and not from the first node.
//Write a program that creates a doubly linked list. Traverse and delete the first node whose value is a palindrome number.
